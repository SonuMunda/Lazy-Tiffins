            <p>We love picky eaters. We love foodies. We love vegetarians. We love health freaks. “Is there any dessert?” We love them too. We love the ones who call. We even love the ones who order online. We love them all.</p>

                <p class="mx-2">Born with a mission to revolutionize eating habits, we believe in providing tiffins in Mumbai that are healthy, homely and hygienic. These meals are ideal for people who are too busy to cook or don’t wish to compromise on nutrition with restaurant food. The menu, at Yummy Tiffins, comes in a variety of mouth-watering cuisines and nutritional options- a judicious mix of carbohydrates and proteins, low calorie content and no artificial flavours/preservatives.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="my-2">Whether it’s Hakka noodles, Cheese Balls or Gulab Jamun. Nutrition doesn’t have to mean bland, boring diets. Ask the dietician on board.</p>
            <p class="my-2">It’s just like you would make it, minus the effort.</p>
            <p class="my-2">The team at Yummy Tiffins ensures that the meals are not only healthy but also appealing to the eye and palette. We believe in giving surprises and breaking monotony, so our menu changes daily and features over 40 dishes that change every day. That includes a variety of vegetables, daal, soups, raita, rice, rotis, salads, and snack items. These are healthy, well-balanced meals cooked in rice bran/olive oil, which provide the right amount of protein along with essential vitamins and minerals. The same food prepared in canteens or Udupi restaurants can be tasty, but is generally oily and big on your pocket.</p>
            <p class="my-2">Yummy Tiffins also offers different meal plans, such as, diabetic meal, low/medium calorie meals, and meals for those who want to put on weight. This means, you can build your own healthy tiffin or choose from 10-12 combo schemes.</p>
            <p class="my-2">Now, relish the tangy vegetable masala, homemade GajarHalwa, and life-changing Garlic Spinach and Chickpea soup</p>
            <p class="my-2">Go on, order as you are.</p>
            <h1 class="text-3xl text-purple-600 py-2">Why us?</h1>
            <p class="py-2">Although you would love to have that fulfilling home cooked meal you enjoyed back in school days it's difficult to manage anything close to that with your busy schedule. What most of us end up eating is not really healthy and at times to our horror even unhygienic food, nutritious meal has become "out of sight, out of mind". It's very important for you to get your daily nutrition - too less or too much is equally harmful, what your health demands is a well balanced and healthy tiffin service.</p>
            <p class="slogan my-4 py-7 px-4 text-xl bg-purple-600 h-full text-center text-white" style="width:100%">" A well balanced and healthy meal can now reach in any nook or corner of Kharar. Choose what you would like for your next meal and we promise to deliver tiffins in Kharar ".</p>
